NAME
    Protect-Unwind - Safe cleanup blocks, Common Lisp style

SYNOPSIS
        use Protect::Unwind;

        protect {
          goto ESCAPE;
        } unwind {
          print "This is printed no matter what happens in protect.";
        };

        ESCAPE:

DESCRIPTION
    This module is just syntactic sugar around Guard. It implements an
    interface like Common Lisp's <unwind-protect>.

    It only exists so that hopefully lisp programmers new to perl will find
    this module before they find the buggy Unwind::Protect.

    Note that if your unwind forms throw exceptions the behaviour is
    somewhat complicated (see the Guard docs).

SEE ALSO
    Guard is a correct and efficient perl "unwind-protect" implementation
    which is why this module uses it.
